Development mode for gems - no build and install after each change,
share gems-in-development between rails/merb apps,
run executables from local bin folder.


Installing
==========
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install senotrusov-gem-here


Staging
=======

1. cd to your home or projects dir

2. run "gem-here"
   It will create the following directories: gem-sources, bin, gems, specifications 

3. Place some gem sources to gem-sources (pull it from github, checkout from subversion, etc.)

4. run "gem-here" one more time from the same dir, so it will:
     - make runners in bin,
     - create symlinks from gems to gem-sources,
     - make dummy gem specifications.
     
   Gem version will be taken from gemname.gemspec file or it will be 999.0.0

Next you can run bins from your gems using bin/foo. 
You may want to add bin to your PATH. If you using your home dir for that some Linux added it automatically.


Using in rails/other application other than gem/bin
===================================================

1. Place your application (rails/merb) in directory some level deep from
   home/project dir where you staged developer gems
   
2. require 'gem-here'

3. require any other gem - it will first be searched in gem-sources


A picture of that
=================

~/bin (here be runners for your gem's bin files)

~/gem-sources (your gems working copies)
~/gem-sources/mygem (like that)
~/gem-sources/mygem/lib
~/gem-sources/mygem/mygem.gemspec

~/gems (symlinks here)
~/specifications (dummy specs here)

~/apps/my-rails-app
~/my-other-rails-app
